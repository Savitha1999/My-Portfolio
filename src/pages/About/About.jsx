                    Hello! Iâ€™m Savitha H., I graduated with a degree in Computer Applications (BCA) from Thiruvalluvar University in 2020, driven by a strong passion for software development. Recently, I completed a Full-Stack MERN Developer course at FITA Academy in Pondicherry.
                    I have developed a solid foundation in web development technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js, Bootstrap, and React Bootstrap.
                    I am now seeking an entry-level position where I can leverage my skills to develop and maintain high-quality websites. I am eager to contribute to a dynamic team and apply my problem-solving abilities in a collaborative environment.
